# Scinote Assignment

This project was created as a solution to the task given to me by the Scinote development team. Instructions can be found in the `instructions` folder in the root of the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

Currently only unit tests for the table generation function are added.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Simply serve the `build` folder and you're in production!
